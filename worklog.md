- Cleaning up `README.md`

- Exploring `gcloud` capabilities. Trying to automate/script the "GCP Project" part of the Apps Script application setup process.
- I've been trying to find a way to automate, or bypass altogether, the process described in [`clasp run` CLI doc](https://github.com/google/clasp/blob/master/docs/run.md). But, for the time being, and according to the official documentation, there is no automated way to associate a Google Apps Script project to a Standard GCP Project to allow Script functions calls through [Apps Script API](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/) :

    - > _**Setup Instructions :** [â€¦] 3. Set the `projectId` to your Apps Script project : [â€¦] - In the menu, click `Resources > Cloud Platform project...` - Paste `Project number` in `Change Project` and click `Set Project`._ [ðŸŒŽ](https://github.com/google/clasp/blob/master/docs/run.md#setup-instructions)
    - > **General procedure for using the Apps Script API to execute Apps Script functions :** [...] **Step 2:** Set up the common Cloud Platform project : _Both your script and the calling application need to share the same Cloud Platform (GCP) project. This GCP project can be an existing project or a new project created for this purpose. Once you have a GCP project, you must **switch your script project to use it**._ [ðŸŒŽ](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/how-tos/execute#step_2_set_up_the_common_cloud_platform_project)
        - > _**Switching to a different standard GCP project :** [â€¦] **(4).** In the Apps Script editor, open the script whose GCP project you want to replace. **(5).** Click **Resources > Cloud Platform project.** **(6).** In the **Change Project** section, paste the project number you copied into the text field, then click **Set Project**. **(7).** A warning screen explains the effects of changing the Cloud Platform project. Read the notice carefully, and click **Confirm**._ [ðŸŒŽ](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects#switching_to_a_different_standard_gcp_project)
    - > _The GCP project must be a [standard GCP project](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects#standard_cloud_platform_projects); default projects created for Apps Script projects are insufficient._ [ðŸŒŽ](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/how-tos/execute)
        - > _**When standard GCP projects are required :** [â€¦] - When you have an application that needs to execute functions in your script project using the Apps Script API's scripts.run method._ [ðŸŒŽ](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects#when_standard_gcp_projects_are_required)

- Apparently, there is no possibility to create credentials for a GCP project through `gcloud` CLI, which is really frustrating :
    - `gcloud` offers only the possibility to [create keys for Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/service-accounts/keys/create).

- Many online resources suggest the use of Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) service to programmatically create OAuth clients :

- **<u>Conslusion :</u>** Using `gcloud` would make some sense only if Google Cloud SDK is already installed and actively used by the developer wanting to deploy this Apps Script project.

## 2020-04-03 - 04-12 (intermittently)
- I had to use [`Fiddler`](https://superuser.com/a/1354620/291080) to intercept sequences of HTTP requests to Drive API URLs while using [`gdrive`](https://github.com/gdrive-org/gdrive) . Trying to mimic these requests using `CURL`.
- After days of researching, I finally managed to find `CURL` command lines corresponding to each of the following Drive operations :
    1. [Not Curl] Construct Access Token request URL; Get the code to use in the next step
    2. Request Access Token / Authorization Code
    3. Request a new Authorization Code using the refresh token
    4. Upload files to Drive; Import XLSX file as a Google SpreadSheet
    5. Create Drive Directory
    6. Move a Drive file to another folder
    7. Other useful operations :
        - Getting information about the authenticated Google user
        - Rename a file in Drive
- `CURL` will be used instead of `gdrive` from now on.
- I will probably document what I have found about dealing with Google Drive API using `curl` in dedicated MD file/Repo/Gist/Blog post.
- So, there is no need now to use Google Apps Script code in order to upload/import files to Drive. Gotta update code accordingly.

- Exploring alternative ways :
    - To make [continuous] deployment of the application as automated as possible.
    - To make the initial setup of the application easy, with one function call.
    - To upload/import files to Drive using just the API, without relying on third-party tools like [`gdrive`](https://github.com/gdrive-org/gdrive).
- Restructuring/Cleaning code.

## 2020-04-01, 04-02
Drafting instructions for project setup using both [`clasp`](https://github.com/google/clasp) and [`gdrive`](https://github.com/gdrive-org/gdrive). Deployed successfully an updated version of the code.
